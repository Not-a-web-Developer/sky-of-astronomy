# The SKY of Astronomy

this is the repository containing everything I have done for the newsletter in a very ugly form (for now).

## How do I use this?

the way I intended for this to work is as follows: 
1. articles are put as word files into `input-articles`;
2. `test.sh` is run;
3. the finished newsletter should show up in `nls`.

## How do I _actually_ use this?
unfortunately for now, you must manually edit `test.mjml` and compile it into the HTML files you wanna send over email.
